horse.com is a non-profit, volunteer based organization rescuing abandoned horses across America. Driven by their love for horses and passion for making things right, celebrity author BaileyAnn Neal and John Fitzgibbon Graham Bell, Alexander Graham Bellâ€™s great-great grandson, designed horse.com to make a difference in a world where everything seems to go wrong.
Nonetheless, something feels off.

Who is really horse.com and what could they be possibly hiding under their saddle. Only you has a chance of unfolding their secrets and change the faith of the equestrian world, forever.

horse.com is a dream turning to NIGHTMARE created to make Pippin Barr laugh. I want to surprise people and fool them and make art that is funky and funny and unique. Art sometimes takes itself too seriously and I'm here to shake it up! I want to tell a well constructed story and create an atmosphere using humour and style.
