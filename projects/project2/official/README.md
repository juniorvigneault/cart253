horse.com is a non-profit, volunteer based organization rescuing abandoned horses across America. Driven by their love for horses and passion for making things right, celebrity author BaileyAnn Neal and John Fitzgibbon Graham Bell, Alexander Graham Bellâ€™s great-great grandson, designed horse.com to make a difference in a world where everything seems to go wrong.
Nonetheless, something feels off.

Who is really horse.com and what could they be possibly hiding under their saddle. Only you has a chance of unfolding their secrets and change the faith of the equestrian world, forever.
